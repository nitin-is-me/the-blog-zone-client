## The Blog zone
The Blog Zone is your personal or public blogging platform without any posting rules. Post whatever you want, but try to maintain the dignity of the platform as much as possible. This repository is hosted directly on vercel, so the code is transparent. You can check the server side code <a href="https://github.com/nitin-is-me/the-blog-zone-server/">here</a>.
### Account creation
You don't need email or any type of identity to signup, just create a username, enter a strong password and you're done.
### Post Privacy
You are given a choice whether you want to make your post publicly visible, or make it private so it's only visible to the author himself.
### Wanna make changes or remove post?
You can edit the post anytime, and for privacy I haven't added the "updatedAt" visibility. Don't like the post? Delete it anytime (I added confirmation prompt later for deletion functions).
### Exact date and time of post
Unlike many social medias where post is in "<time> ago" format, you'll see exact date and time of your post. (I implementing "<time> ago" format before, but exact time is more practical).
### Scalable and rigid database
I've switched from Non - relational database (MongoDB) to Relational database (PostgreSQL), so the application is scalable, and the data relations are much better and strong.
### Show what you feel about a post
You can comment on a post to tell what you feel about the post, and can delete it whenever you want.
